/* 
Write a function called removeEntry() to remove an entry from a linked list. 
The sole argument to the procedure should be a pointer to the list. 
Have the function remove the entry after the one pointed to by the argument. 
(Why canâ€™t you remove the entry pointed to by the argument?) 
You need to use the special structure you set up in exercise 3 to handle the 
special case of removing the first element from the list.
